how to find lowest common denominator of infinity numbers 
we check every step if a one or more numbers of the list is divisible by
prime number if yes we divide the number by the prime and check again 
if no number is divisible by prime we try next prime until all the numbers are
equal to 1 then we multiply all the prime numbers that we divided before 
and got the lowest common denominator 

example:
numbers are 12,8,9
12,8,9|2
6,4, 9|2
3,2, 9|3
1,2, 3|2
1,1, 3|3
1,1, 1
